# Image Restoration Model with Defect Preservation

## Architecture Details and Design Choices

### Base Architecture Selection: UNet
I chose UNet as the base architecture for several key reasons:
- The encoder-decoder structure is ideal for image-to-image translation tasks
- Built-in skip connections help preserve essential spatial information
- Effective handling of both local and global features
- Proven track record in medical image segmentation where detail preservation is crucial

### Key Modifications to Base Architecture

#### 1. Channel Attention Mechanism
Implementation of CBAM-style attention because:
- Helps the model focus on important features in both clean and defect areas
- Adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses
- Particularly effective for identifying subtle defect features

```python
class ChannelAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels, reduction_ratio=16):
        # Dual pooling for comprehensive feature information
        self.avg_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
        self.max_pool = nn.AdaptiveMaxPool2d(1)
```

#### 2. Modified Skip Connections
Enhanced the original UNet skip connections:
- Implemented controllable skip connections with [False, False, False, False] configuration
- Balanced feature propagation
- Prevented excessive low-level feature transfer
- Enabled selective feature utilization from encoder layers

#### 3. Defect-Aware Processing
Added specialized mask attention:
```python
self.mask_attention = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(1, 64, 3, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
    nn.Conv2d(64, 1, 1),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)
```
Benefits:
- Separate processing for defect and non-defect regions
- Enhanced defect preservation during restoration
- Adaptive processing based on defect location

### Custom Loss Function Design

Implemented a multi-component loss function:
```python
total_loss = (0.25 * defect_loss +     
              0.30 * ssim_loss +        
              0.20 * perceptual_loss +  
              0.15 * edge_loss +        
              0.10 * basic_loss)        
```

#### Loss Components:

1. **Defect Loss (0.25)**
   - Priority focus on defect regions
   - Weighted mask for defect emphasis
   - Maintains defect characteristics

2. **SSIM Loss (0.30)**
   - Ensures structural similarity
   - Highest weight for balanced restoration
   - Critical for overall image quality

3. **Perceptual Loss (0.20)**
   - VGG-based feature extraction
   - Maintains perceptual quality
   - Natural-looking results

4. **Edge Loss (0.15)**
   - Edge information preservation
   - Critical for defect boundaries
   - Sobel filter implementation

5. **Basic Loss (0.10)**
   - L1 and MSE combination
   - Basic pixel-level supervision
   - Foundation for other losses

### Training Strategy

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with 1e-4 learning rate
- **Scheduler**: CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts
- **Regularization**: Dropout rate 0.15
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 25 epochs
- **Batch Size**: 8 for stable training

### Results

#### Overall Performance
- PSNR: 26.09 dB
- SSIM: 0.74

#### Defect Region Performance
- Defect PSNR: 42.95 dB
- Defect SSIM: 0.99

These metrics demonstrate:
- Excellent defect preservation
- Strong overall image restoration
- Well-balanced performance
